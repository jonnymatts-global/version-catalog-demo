# Version Catalog - libs.versions.toml

This example is pretty much the same as the settings.gradle example, with the only difference being where the version
catalog is defined.

The version catalog is defined in a [libs.versions.toml file](gradle/libs.versions.toml) in the `gradle` directory.

The [format of the file](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub::toml-dependencies-format) is
the exact format of a version catalog when generated by Gradle (such as when using settings.gradle).

By specifying the versions in their own file with a defined format, it can be easier to configure tooling to read
the file and manage dependency versions automatically.
